For insertrandom: 
What would you like L to be?: 10

Enter # strings to insert into ULLMap: 10000 
class ULLMap: 0.51 sec

Enter # strings to insert into your BSTMap: 10000
class BSTMap: 0.03 sec

Enter # strings to insert into Java's TreeMap: 10000
Java's Built-in TreeMap: 0.02 sec


For insertinorder: 
 This program inserts lexicographically increasing Stringsinto Maps as <String, Integer> pairs.

Enter # strings to insert into ULLMap: 10000
class ULLMap: 1.14 sec

Enter # strings to insert into BSTMap: 10000
class BSTMap: 1.06 sec

Enter # strings to insert into Java's TreeMap: 10000
Java's Built-in TreeMap: 0.02 sec


If you insert in order, the BSTMap has to do a linear search to find the
insertion node so performance degrades to that of ULLMap.
